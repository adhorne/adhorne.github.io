        <h2>About</h2> 
        <p>Hello, my name is Austin Horne, I am 23-years-old, and I was born and raised in Florida. So, you can say that I know the Fort Myers area well. I am enrolled at Fgcu. And Im working on getting my bachelor degree in software engineering. I think my drive for this decision was the fact that I love technology and video games. I would like a job related to technology or something in the video game industry. Where I could be designing the characters, or creating the software that goes into game consoles. The journey to get where I am now has been long and sometimes stressful. I try to stay focused on my goals. One thing that I always keep in mind is success is a choice.</p>
        <h3>Skills</h3>
        <p>Throughout my life in school I have learned many things. A lot of those things involved computer programs sure enough. I have a certification in abode photoshop CS6, Microsoft word 2010, and Microsoft PowerPoint 2010.  So, I know my way around these programs. In Abode photoshop one of my most memorable things was creating a logo for an elementary school. It was the same elementary school I went to which was cool. Also, the logo I made was one of two that was sent off to be chosen by them but unfortunately, they didnt use mine. But it was still an amazing project for me.</p>
        <h4>Experience</h4>   
        <p>I've had a lot of experience using the programs I talked about earlier.  One project that I remember most was for my psychology class when I attended FSW.  We had to watch a movie and write a paper about what psychology disorder we though the main character had and we had to back it up with research. In that paper, I got a 90 and my professor congratulated me on it. Also, I have made many PowerPoints with all the bells and whistles. They are clear and dont have a ton of information on them so its not hard to look at anything you need to know on them. One project that I remember was a project for my public speech class. I had to create a speech about something we were interested in and give some background knowledge in what we were talking about. I talked about film noir and it went good. My professor congratulated me and the class voted me the one they enjoyed the most. Lastly   Ive created quite a few things in photoshop. Ive made a title paper to a website in photoshop, done a logo for an elementary school like I talked about earlier, and made an album cover front to back. My knowledge has helped me a lot and I am proud of my accomplishments.</p>
